# RiÍœb

**Requests In Batches**

A service acting as a proxy in front of an HTTP JSON API.
It allows sending batches of requests against the underlying API.
This leads to less roundtrips between clients and the cloud.

## Try it out!

    docker run -e RIB_BACKEND=https://api.github.com \
      -d -p 3000:3000 --name rib stylefruits/rib
    curl -i http://docker:3000/v1/batch \
      -d '[{"uri": "/", "method": "get"}]'

## Running

Install `rebar` and

    rebar get-deps compile
    erl -pa ebin -pa deps/*/ebin -noshell -s rib start

If the service is running give it a try using

    curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/batch -d '[
      {"uri": "/", "method": "get"}
    ]'

Run tests with

    rebar compile eunit

## Coverage analysis

```erlang
cover:start().
Modules = cover:compile_directory("src").
[eunit:test(Mod) || {ok, Mod} <- cover:compile_directory("test")].
[cover:analyse_to_file(M, atom_to_list(M) ++ ".html", [html])
    || {ok, M} <- Modules].
```
